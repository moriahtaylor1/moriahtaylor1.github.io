                Moriah is a 2019 graduate of Duke University who has a passion for all things data-related, as well
                as an interest in the natural sciences. She currently resides in her hometown of Columbus, OH and is
                working towards a certificate in Data Analysis and Visualization from the University of North Carolina -
                Chapel Hill. Some topics that interest her are machine learning, equality in AI, data journalism, climate
                change, and geology.

                Outside of school and work, you can usually still find Moriah coding as she loves to participate in Twitter
                community projects such as <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#TidyTuesday</a>, 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Z3tt/30DayChartChallenge_Collection2021">#30daychartchallenge</a>, 
                and the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/03/11/time-to-shiny/">R Shiny Contest</a>. If she's not on her
                laptop, Moriah unwinds by playing video games or relaxing with her Olde English Bulldogge, Stitch (who has 
                her very own instagram <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/oldeenglishstitch/">@oldeenglishstitch</a>).
